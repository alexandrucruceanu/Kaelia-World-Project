## 🖋️ Etymology and Denomination
The name **Kaelia** (pronounced *Kay-lee-ah*) is the standardized global identifier for the planet, codified by the scholars of the **Betereko Plateau** to facilitate inter-continental trade and navigation.

*   **Root Origins:**
    *   **Kae (Kasyal):** Derived from the Kasy root for *"Wellspring"* or *"Living Water."*
    *   **Lia (Gaelic/Keunmorian):** Derived from the ancient Keunmorian word for *"Stone"* or *"Vessel."*
*   **Common Translation:** *"The Vessel of Life"* or *"The Wellspring Rock."*
*   **Cultural Variants:** While Nordicans often refer to it simply as **Mid-Ice** or **The Great Hearth**, the term Kaelia is used in all official naval charts and diplomatic treaties between the five landmasses.

## 🌌 Cosmology & Global Physics
*   **Planetary Type:** Earth-like (Terrestrial).
*   **Orbit:** Single star (G-type), roughly 1.1 AU. Year length ~380 days.
*   **Tectonics:** Highly active; diverse mountain ranges and deep oceanic ridges.
*   **Climate:** Realistic weather system with polar caps, strong trade winds, and defined seasonal variations.
*   **Technology Level:** **Modern / Information Age** (equivalent to 21st Century Earth).
*   **Development Philosophy:** **Modern-Ancient Synthesis**. Unlike Earth, Kaelia's development was characterized by **Minimal Colonization**. Each continent achieved modern technological levels independently, preserving their ancestral traditions, aesthetics, and social structures. Technology is viewed as a high-fidelity extension of cultural heritage rather than a replacement for it.
*   **Anomalies:** Low Magic. "Magic" is scientifically categorized as an advanced understanding of environmental energies (e.g., Quantum Wind-Grids in Gryning).
