## 🖋️ Etymology and Denomination
The name **Kaelia** (pronounced *Kay-lee-ah*) is the standardized global identifier for the planet, codified by the scholars of the **Betereko Plateau** to facilitate inter-continental trade and navigation.

*   **Root Origins:**
    *   **Kae (Kasyal):** Derived from the Kasy root for *"Wellspring"* or *"Living Water."*
    *   **Lia (Gaelic/Keunmorian):** Derived from the ancient Keunmorian word for *"Stone"* or *"Vessel."*
*   **Common Translation:** *"The Vessel of Life"* or *"The Wellspring Rock."*
*   **Cultural Variants:** While Nordicans often refer to it simply as **Mid-Ice** or **The Great Hearth**, the term Kaelia is used in all official naval charts and diplomatic treaties between the five landmasses.

## 🌌 Cosmology & Global Physics
*   **Planetary Type:** Earth-like (Terrestrial).
*   **Orbit:** Single star (G-type), roughly 1.1 AU. Year length ~380 days.
*   **Tectonics:** Highly active; diverse mountain ranges and deep oceanic ridges.
*   **Climate:** Realistic weather system with polar caps, strong trade winds, and defined seasonal variations.
*   **Technology Level:** **Modern / Information Age** (equivalent to 21st Century Earth).
*   **Development Philosophy:** **Modern-Ancient Synthesis**. Unlike Earth, Kaelia's development was characterized by **Minimal Colonization**. Each continent achieved modern technological levels independently, preserving their ancestral traditions, aesthetics, and social structures. Technology is viewed as a high-fidelity extension of cultural heritage rather than a replacement for it.
*   **Anomalies:** Low Magic. "Magic" is scientifically categorized as an advanced understanding of environmental energies (e.g., Quantum Wind-Grids in Gryning).

## 🌍 Global Geography Overview
The planet is defined by a severe **North-South Temperature Gradient**. The Northern Hemisphere is locked in Cryosphere (Ice) and Boreal (Taiga) zones, while the Southern Hemisphere enjoys Temperate and Subtropical climates.

---

## 🏔️ Continent 1: Nordica
* **Location:** North-West Hemisphere
* **Visual Biome:** **Alpine Tundra (Grey)** & **Boreal Forest (Purple)**
* **Corrected Climate:** **Sub-Arctic / Taiga.**
* *Correction:* Previous references to "Temperate" zones are removed except for the extreme southern tip. This is a harsh, frozen continent.

### 1. Gryning (The Wind Coast)
* **Biome:** **Boreal Forest (Purple)**.
* **Geography:** Dense, dark coniferous forests (Taiga) that run right up to the jagged western coast. The trees here are ancient and hardy, adapted to low light and heavy snow.
* **Infrastructure Match:** The **Global Wind-Grid** towers rise *above* the dense tree line to catch the high-altitude laminar flow winds, as the forest floor is too wind-blocked by vegetation.
* **Culture:** Stoic, digital-wind adapters. Traditional seafaring has evolved into high-tech autonomous fishing fleets.

## 🔍 Strategic Resource Correction
Based on the Biome Map, the global economy is driven by **Scarcity**:

1. **Arable Land is Rare:** Only the **Southern Rim of Antarmund** and parts of **Kasy** (Green zones) can grow food efficiently. The entire Northern half of the world (Grey/Purple) is food-dependent.
2. **Fuel/Timber Dominance:** **Nordica** and **The Mirelands** (Purple zones) control the planet's biomass fuel and paper/pulp supply.
3. **Solar Monopoly:** **Kasy** (Yellow/Chaparral) has the only high-efficiency solar index (Dry Summers). The cloudy/rainy North and East cannot rely on solar.
