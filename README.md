# 🌍 Project Kaelia (formerly World_Building_Project)
**A Modern-Ancient Synthesis of a Lost World.**

Kaelia is a realistic fictional world in its **Information Age**, originally developed from the 2014 archives. Unlike standard tropes, Kaelia is a **Synthesized World** where advanced technology (equivalent to 21st-century Earth) exists in perfect harmony with deep-seated ancestral traditions. 

Each continent developed its own modern infrastructure independently, leading to a planet of high regional identity and minimal globalized colonization. This repository serves as the modern "Command Center" for the restoration and expansion of this project.

## 📜 Core Lore
The project focuses exclusively on **Kaelia**, a single terrestrial planet defined by a severe **North-South Temperature Gradient**. Key features include the frozen taigas of **Nordica**, the Mediterranean chaparrals of the **Kasy Federation**, and the lush temperate rainforests of **Antarmund**.

It combines geography, simulated climatology (Whittaker Classification), and 3D modeling to bring the "Modern-Ancient Synthesis" to life.

> **Note:** Originally conceived as a solar system, the scope has been refined to focus exclusively on this single, detailed world. Geography and climate data were strictly unified in **Version 2.1 (Biome-Corrected)**.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into a functional hierarchy to separate raw design sources from public assets and interactive applications.

### 🏗️ 01_Design_Sources
Contains original, multi-layer editable files for all world-building creative work.
*   `.c4d`: 3D planetary models (Cinema4D).
*   `.ftw`: Fractal Terrains world files (elevation and climate data).
*   `.psd`: High-resolution map and infographic source layers (Photoshop).

### 🎨 02_Visual_Assets
Finished exports and media organized by scale.
*   **1.0_Planet_Scale/**: Global datasets including `Cartography/` (maps), `Planetary_Renders/` (renders), and `Climatology_&_Data/` (infographics).
*   **2.0_Regional_Scale/**: Concept art and high-fidelity captures for each major landmass:
    *   `Nordica`, `Kasy_Federation`, `Betereko`, `The_Mirelands` (Central-North), `Antarmund` (Eastern Super-continent).
    *   `Ax_Pelak_Yeldo` (Central Archipelago).
*   **3.0_Orbital_&_Meta/**: Satellite imagery and orbital logistics hubs.

### 💻 03_Applications
Interactive tools used to explore the world.
*   **[Map Viewer](file:///g:/Mi%20unidad/01_Alex/30_Tecnologia_y_Proyectos/World_Building_Project/03_Applications/Map_Viewer/index.html):** Modern Leaflet.js interactive explorer.
*   **[Legacy Viewer](file:///g:/Mi%20unidad/01_Alex/30_Tecnologia_y_Proyectos/World_Building_Project/03_Applications/Legacy_Viewer/Public%20link.htm):** Original 2014 zoomable tiled map.

### 📦 04_Archive
Non-essential historical data, solar system sheets, and raw frame sequences.
