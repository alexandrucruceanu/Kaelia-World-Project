# 🌍 Project Kaelia (formerly World_Building_Project)
**A Modern-Ancient Synthesis of a Lost World.**

Kaelia is a realistic fictional world in its **Information Age**, originally developed from the 2014 archives. Unlike standard tropes, Kaelia is a **Synthesized World** where advanced technology (equivalent to 21st-century Earth) exists in perfect harmony with deep-seated ancestral traditions. 

Each continent developed its own modern infrastructure independently, leading to a planet of high regional identity and minimal globalized colonization. This repository serves as the modern "Command Center" for the restoration and expansion of this project.

## 📜 Core Lore
The project focuses exclusively on **Kaelia**, a single terrestrial planet where skyscrapers stand beside ancient shrines, and quantum grids are tuned to ancestral winds.
combines geography, simulated climatology, and 3D modeling to bring the world of **"Nordica"** (and its neighboring continents) to life.

> **Note:** Originally conceived as a solar system, the scope has been refined to focus exclusively on this single, detailed world. Legacy solar system files have been archived.

## 📂 Project Structure

### `WORLD_CODEX.md`
The master reference document. Integrates all geopolitical data, culture, geography, and cosmology into a single unified guide.

### `IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md`
A library of high-fidelity prompts for visualizing the world of Kaelia (National Geographic meets High Fantasy).

### `Docs/` - Source Models
*   **3D Models (Cinema 4D):**
    *   `Kaelia.c4d`: Base planetary model.
    *   `Kaelia ver 2.c4d`: Iteration 2.
*   **Terrain Generation:** `Kaelia Equirectangular.ftw` (Fractal Terrains Pro).

### `Video/` - Audiovisual Production
Animations and renders.
*   **Final Renders:** `Kaelia 3D full.mov`, `Gaia.mp4`.
*   **Data Layers:** `Climate.mp4`, `Rainfall.mp4`, `Temperature.mp4`.
*   **Editing:** `Kaelia Equirectangular Spin View Sequence_1.prproj`.

### `Graphs/` - Climate Data
Static visualizations.
*   `Climate (Temperature - Rainfall Graph).psd`.

### `Archive/`
*   `Sistem solar.xlsx`: Legacy overarching solar system concepts (Depreciated).

### `...Equirectangular.../`
Texture maps and frame sequences for spherical mapping.
*   **Main Map:** `Kaelia Equirectangular Sphere Map Names & Frontiers.jpg` - Political map.
    *   This file defines the "official" political and geographical distribution of the world.
    *   **Continent 1 (Nordica):** Located in the North-West. Cold region inspired by Nordic/Celtic cultures.
        *   *Visual Assets:* `Docs/Assets/Nordica/Gryning/`
        *   *Countries:* **Gryning** (West, windy), **Oighear** (Massive Northern territory), **Keunmor** (Mountainous/Mining), **Brechar** (East, forests), and **Kornmor** (South, temperate).
        *   *Key Capitals:* Skýjakot (Gryning), Khuruldai (Oighear), Ardmore (Keunmor).
    *   **Continent 2:** "Kasy" region (Yokasy, Vorkasy, Pomkasy...).
    *   **Continent 3 (Betereko):** Landmass dominated by the nation of Betereko.
    *   **Continent 4:** "Az/Ts" region (Niruz, Aghaz, Misyats...).
    *   **Continent 5:** Southern region with Germanic/Fantasy names (Norgborg, Guldhorn, Metsemania).

*   `Kaelia Equirectangular Sphere Map`: Projected texture maps.
*   `Interactive_Map/`: **[NEW] Modern Map Viewer**. Open `index.html` to view the high-resolution maps of Kaelia.
*   `Kaelia Multiple Files`: *(Legacy)* Interactive Web Map. A tiled HTML/JPG structure allowing for deep-zoom exploration. Entry point: `Public link.htm`.

## 🛠️ Tools Used (Reconstruction) based on files
*   **Fractal Terrains 3 / Pro:** For procedural generation of continents, altitude, and climate (`.ftw`).
*   **Cinema 4D:** For 3D rendering and texturing of the globe (`.c4d`).
*   **Adobe Premiere Pro:** For compositing video layers (`.prproj`).
*   **Photoshop:** For map and graphics editing (`.psd`).
*   **Google Docs:** For lore writing (`.gdoc` -> `.md`).
